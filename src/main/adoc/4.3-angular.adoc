[[_introduction]]
Angular
-------

[cols="1a,6a",frame="none"]
|===
|image::images/Angular_full_color_logo.svg.png[width="120"]|
* web application platform
* based on typescript, a superset of JavaScript +
  (object oriented, static typing, generics)
* dependency injection
* reactive programming
* ...
|===


NgZone
------

* zone =  an execution context in which all events are intercepted in the JS engine +
  (functions invocations, errors/returns, timeouts, promises...)
* all native methods are overridden by augmented versions of the methods (= ''monkey patching'')
* may cause lots of overhead for code with intensive processing
* can be disabled like this:

[source,javascript] // should be typescript
-----
this.ngZone.runOutsideAngularZone(() => {
  // some code
})
-----


Change detection
----------------

* Angular detects ''automagically'' when data changes, to update the HTML view
* There is a potential change each time an async method is invoked +
  (trigered thanks to NgZone)
* Traverse the entire component tree and compare data with latest known version
* CPU intensive


Change detection (Observable)
-----------------------------

Use reactive programming, see Redux/ngrx:

* "Smart" components use only `@Observable`
* Angular disables change detection for components whose `@Observable` have not emmitted any new value


Change detection (Immutable)
----------------------------

* Objects comparison is much more performant with ''immutable objects'' +
  (compare object reference, instead of making a deep attributes comparison)
* "Dumb" components use only immutable objects as `@input`
* This code tells Angular that your component is using only immutable objects:

[source,javascript] // should be typescript
-----
@Component() {
  template: //...
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
class XxxxxComponent {
  @Input() //...
}
-----


[[_ngfor]]
*ngFor
------

* By default, `*ngFor` dismisses and recreates to whole DOM of the component
* It has performance impact for complicated lists
* Keep track of each element of the collection, so that Angular recreates only those:

[source,javascript] // should be typescript
-----
<div *ngFor="let item of collection;trackBy: trackByFn">...</div>
-----


[[_aot]]
Ahead Of Time compilation
-------------------------

During development, JIT compiler is used:

* compiler must be downloaded
* compilation takes time during application boot

In production, it is recommended use "Ahead Of Time" (AOT) compilation:

* bundling
* inlining
* precompiler code
* minification
* dead code ("Rollup")
* ...
