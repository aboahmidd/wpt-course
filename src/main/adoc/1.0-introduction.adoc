Why should we optimize websites?
--------------------------------

* Improve user experience
* Improve page ranking (SEO)
* Mobile compliance
* UI logic is shifting to the front-end => increasing complexity

Some figures:

* 94.4% of web sites use JavaScript (as of 2016-Dec)
* users abandon a web site after 2s of waiting
* 90% of the waiting time is spent *after* the HTML has been retrieved
* 80% of the waiting time is spent *in* the front-end


Scope
-----

"Transport" section:

* all kinds of web apps

"CPU" and "Memory" sections:

* Web apps with browser side logic
** traditional (eg JSF) with "smart" components, AJAX...
** SPA (Single Page Apps)
* i.e. applications relying heavily on JavaScript

Out-of-scope:

* animations, games...


Exercises
---------

Exercises will be based on:

* the Chrome browser,
* Blink(WebKit) rendering engine,
* V8 JavaScript engine.


Disclaimer
----------

* We're still learning
* Landscape evolves extremely rapidly
* Optimizing a web app is more an art than a science
